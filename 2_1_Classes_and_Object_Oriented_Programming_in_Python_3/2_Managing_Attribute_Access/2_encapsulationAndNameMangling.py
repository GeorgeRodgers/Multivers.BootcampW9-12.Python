# Unlike JavaScript, python is designed to be open and so it is not possible to create private attributes in the same way
# The convention is to put an underscore before the attribute name to inform the user that the attribute is 'non-public'
# If you really need to stop access outside of a class you can use 'name mangling', this is where you prepend the attribute name with a double underscore
